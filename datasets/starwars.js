        "description": "Yoda, a Force-sensitive male member of a mysterious species, was a legendary Jedi Master who witnessed the rise and fall of the Galactic Republic, as well as the rise of the Galactic Empire. An ancient Jedi revered for his advanced age and wisdom, Yoda served as Grand Master of the Jedi Order during the latter days of the Republic and also held a seat on the Jedi High Council along with other legendary masters such as Mace Windu and Ki-Adi-Mundi. For over eight-hundred years, he mentored others in the ways of the Force and had a hand in the training of many Jedi during their time as younglings.Approximately thirty-two years before the Battle of Yavin, Anakin Skywalker was presented as the Chosen One to the High Council by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Although the former slave from Tatooine demonstrated exceptional sensitivity to the Force, Yoda and his colleagues declined to train him due to the fear they sensed within him. The High Council later reversed its decision in the wake of Jinn's death despite the dissenting opinion of Yoda, who sensed that Skywalker represented grave danger to the future of the Jedi Order. Over the next decade, the galaxy became increasingly destabilized by a secessionist movement that threatened to tear the Republic asunder. When it became evident that the Confederacy of Independent Systems intended to secede from the Republic by force of arms, Yoda oversaw the deployment of thousands of clone troopers to Geonosis, where the first battle of the Clone Wars commenced.As a Jedi General of the Grand Army of the Republic, Yoda's time was spent directing the Jedi in their new role as wartime leaders, negotiating with potential allies such as King Katuunko of Toydaria, and leading clones on the battlefield against the Separatist Droid Army. By the third year of the galactic conflict, the Jedi discovered that Darth Sidious and Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine were one and the same. Yoda's colleagues on the High Council moved to arrest the Sith Lord, but Skywalker's betrayal thwarted their efforts and led to the start of the Jedi Purge through Order 66. Across the galaxy, the Jedi Knights and their apprentices fell victim to the secret kill order that the clones had been programmed to obey. Yoda survived the attempt on his life, however, but later fled into exile after failing to kill the self-appointed Galactic Emperor.he Grand Master spent the last two decades of his life on the planet Dagobah, where he was found by Anakin's son, Luke Skywalker, who endeavored to complete his training in the Jedi arts. On his deathbed, Yoda confirmed that Luke's father had become Darth Vader—the Emperor's apprentice in the dark side of the Force. After a lifespan of nine-hundred years, Yoda succumbed to death, shedding his mortal coil and becoming one with the Force. Shortly afterward, the prophecy of the Chosen One was realized when Vader killed his Sith Master at the cost of his own life in order to save his son. This act of self-sacrifice allowed the late Yoda to preserve the Anakin's consciousness in the Force. As the Rebel Alliance celebrated their victory over the Empire, Luke saw the spirits of his mentors, Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, standing beside a redeemed Anakin Skywalker as they watched over him and his friends.Yoda would again visit the realm of the living from the Netherworld of the Force roughly thirty years after the Battle of Endor. By then, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker was a broken man who lived as a hermit on Ahch-To. It had been Yoda's dying wish to see Skywalker restore the Jedi Order by passing on what he had learned to a new generation of Jedi Knights. Skywalker made the attempt, but the fall of his gifted nephew, Ben Solo, all but destroyed his plans, leading him to believe that it was time for the Jedi to end. With Yoda's help, Skywalker overcame his guilt and subsequently became one with the Force, passing the mantle of the Jedi to the Jakku scavenger Rey."

        "description": "Luke Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a legendary Jedi Master who fought in the Galactic Civil War during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his companions, Princess Leia Organa and Captain Han Solo, Skywalker served on the side of the Alliance to Restore the Republic—an organization committed to the downfall of Emperor Palpatine and the restoration of democracy. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic history. The son of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born along with his twin sister Leia in 19 BBY. As a result of Amidala's death and Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force, the Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family of Alderaan while Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star. He continued his training in the years that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in Grand Master Yoda. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, during which he confronted the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he learned was in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to the light side of the Force by destroying the Emperor at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One. With the Sith's destruction and the subsequent capitulation of the Empire in 5 ABY, Luke Skywalker traveled across the galaxy, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the Jedi Order. One of his apprentices was his sister's son, Ben Solo, who inherited the Skywalker bloodline's raw strength and potential for limitless power. The loss of his nephew, who fell to the dark side like Vader before him, haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life. In addition, the destruction of his nascent Order convinced him that the time had come for the Jedi to end. He therefore sought exile on the distant world of Ahch-To, having elected to live out his remaining days as a hermit while ignoring the galaxy's pleas for help during the rise of the First Order. His solitude was interrupted in 34 ABY, shortly after the fall of the New Republic, resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to play one last, momentous role in the conflict between light and darkness. Although he passed away into the Force, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would not die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the Jakku scavenger known as Rey."

        "description": "Darth Vader also known as Anakin Skywalker was a Force-sensitive Human male who served the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Knight and later served the Galactic Empire as the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Born to the slave Shmi Skywalker in 41.9 BBY, Anakin was conceived by midi-chlorians, the symbiotic organisms that allowed individuals to touch the Force, and he and his mother were brought to the desert planet of Tatooine to be the slaves of Gardulla the Hutt. They soon ended up as the property of the Toydarian Watto, and Skywalker exhibited exceptional piloting skills and a reputation for being able to build and repair anything even at a young age. In 32 BBY, Skywalker encountered the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Padmé Amidala, and he helped them secure the parts they needed for their starship by winning the Boonta Eve Classic podracing event—only to learn that he had also won his freedom in doing so. Reluctantly leaving his mother behind, Skywalker accompanied Jinn and his group to the Republic's capital of Coruscant and participated in the Battle of Naboo, helping to free Amidala's homeworld from the armies of the Trade Federation. While Jinn was killed during the battle, Jinn's student Obi-Wan Kenobi followed Jinn's wishes and took on Skywalker as his Padawan, and much of the Jedi Council believed that Skywalker was the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy: one who would bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith Order. Skywalker and Kenobi had a number of adventures during the Padawan's decade of training to become a Jedi, but as the Separatist Crisis threatened to tear the Republic apart in 22 BBY, Skywalker was reunited with Amidala when he was assigned to protect her from assassins. The two grew close during the course of the assignment, though they were caught up in the Battle of Geonosis and the beginning of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Losing an arm during the fighting, Skywalker received a cybernetic replacement, and he and Amidala were secretly married in the days after the battle, despite the Jedi Code's restrictions on romantic attachments. During the Clone Wars, which raged for the next three years, Skywalker was granted the rank of Jedi Knight and became known to the public as the \"Hero with No Fear.\" Taking on the Togruta Ahsoka Tano as his apprentice, Skywalker fought alongside Kenobi and his fellow Jedi in scores of battles, and his friendship with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine deepened despite the Jedi Order's wariness of Palpatine's rapid acquisition of further powers during the course of the war. Throughout the Clone Wars, Skywalker's anger and sense of loss pushed him ever closer to the dark side of the Force, and his visions of Amidala dying in childbirth in 19 BBY made him desperate to find a way to save his wife. Palpatine, who was in fact the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, manipulated Skywalker into becoming his apprentice with the promise of saving Amidala, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader as Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and eradicated the Jedi Order. Vader and Kenobi clashed on Mustafar after Vader attacked his wife in the belief that she had betrayed him, and the newly christened Sith Lord was left limbless and ravaged by fire at the end of their battle. Encased in a suit of life-sustaining black armor and believing his wife to be dead, Vader embraced his role as the Emperor's right hand and enforcer, hunting down Jedi survivors and enforcing the will of the Empire for years to come. The Sith Lord trained a number of secret apprentices and Dark Jedi, though his plans to overthrow his master had not advanced far when the Galactic Civil War erupted between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic in 2 BBY. In 0 BBY, the Death Star—the Empire's greatest superweapon—was destroyed by a young Rebel pilot despite Vader's efforts, and Vader became obsessed with discovering the pilot's identity, only to learn that it was Luke Skywalker: his own son, born before Amidala's death. Vader continued to pursue both Skywalker and the Alliance over the next three years, finally luring his son into a trap on the mining colony of Cloud City in 3 ABY where the two dueled. Vader revealed his identity to Skywalker, though his son refused to join him and escaped. When Darth Sidious learned of Skywalker's existence, he set in motion his own plans to recruit Skywalker and thereby replace Vader, but Skywalker surrendered himself to Imperial forces on the forest moon of Endor in 4 ABY in hopes of redeeming his father and turning him back to the light side. In a final duel on the second Death Star as the Battle of Endor raged around them, Skywalker and Vader fought each other, and Vader refused his son's attempts to redeem him, learning that Skywalker had a twin sister named Leia in the process. Skywalker defeated his father but refused to kill him, and when Sidious attempted to kill the young man, Vader—moved by his son's love—abandoned the dark side and sacrificed himself to destroy the Emperor, fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One. Mortally wounded, Anakin made peace with his son and became one with the Force, though his reputation, his legacy, and his family endured for decades afterwards."

        "description": "Revan—renowned as the Revanchist, honored as the Revan, reviled as Revan the Butcher, dreaded as the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Revan, and praised as the Prodigal Knight—was a Human male who played pivotal roles as both Jedi and Sith in the Mandalorian Wars, Jedi Civil War, and Great Galactic War. Believed to have been born around 3994 BBY in the Outer Rim Territories, the child later known as Revan was found by the Jedi Order and became apprenticed to the Jedi Master Kreia. The Padawan had an insatiable hunger for knowledge and learned everything she and many other Masters knew, quickly becoming the Jedi’s most promising pupil. Alongside his friend Malak, he became a Jedi Knight and a vocal and charismatic critic of the Order's inactivity in the ongoing Mandalorian Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. In defiance of the Jedi Council, the Knight took upon the name Revan and started the Revanchist movement to combat the Mandalorians as the Republic Military's Supreme Commander. Revan and his forces gradually pushed back the Mandalorians, saving countless worlds at the price of devastating moral compromises and the embrace of dark side practices. On Malachor V, Revan defeated the Mandalorian leader Mandalore the Ultimate in single-combat and ordered the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon, destroying both armies and the planet but winning the war in the process. Revan and Malak, now hailed as the greatest of heroes, vanished into the Unknown Regions investigating a mysterious Sith influence behind the war. They discovered a hidden Sith Empire and had their minds warped by the Sith Emperor Vitiate. The newly anointed Darth Revan and Darth Malak were directed to find the mystical Star Forge to escalate the Sith’s plans for invasion, but the pair broke free from Vitiate’s control and used the Star Forge for themselves, creating their own Sith Empire and a fleet of warships. Intent on unifying the galaxy to destroy the Emperor and the hidden Sith threat, they returned to the galaxy as conquers and waged war against the Jedi and the Republic in the resultant Jedi Civil War. Revan won battle after battle and many worlds, inspired by his past sacrifices, joined his cause willingly. In a desperate gamble to end the war, a Jedi strike team led by Bastila Shan ambushed Revan's fleet. The nearby and power-hungry Malak took advantage of Revan's distraction and fired aboard Revan's flagship. Revan was nearly killed, but Bastila kept him alive through the Force and took him back before the surviving Jedi for judgment. The Jedi Council used their powers to wipe Revan’s mind and soon retrained him as a Jedi. Alongside Bastila and newfound companions, Revan was tasked to relocate the Star Forge—the source of the reigning Darth Malak’s growing powers. Revan picked up more allies and fell in love with Bastila across his journey, but they were eventually intercepted by Malak’s flagship. Malak revealed to Revan his true identity as the former Dark Lord, then captured and corrupted Bastila to the dark side. Revan escaped and, in a last stand, led the remaining Republic fleet against the Star Forge, redeemed Bastila back to the light side, and killed Malak in battle, ultimately destroying the Sith Empire he created. Again the galaxy's savior, Revan married Bastila and sank into obscurity until he began to have visions of a mysterious threat from his past and left his wife and unborn child behind in search for answers. Revan rediscovered Vitiate’s Sith Empire and, alongside his former protégé Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile, and the Sith Lord Scourge, attempted to assassinate the Emperor. However, Scourge betrayed the pair, killing Meetra and allowing Revan to be overwhelmed by the Emperor.  Revan was placed in stasis for three-hundred years, his mind probed and ravaged by the Emperor. Revan telepathically influenced Vitiate in return, stalling his invasion for centuries, then initiating a temporary armistice before total Sith victory was achieved. Revan was eventually freed by Republic forces and took control of the Foundry space station to construct an army of extermination droids against the Empire, but he was defeated and killed by an Imperial strike team before his plans came to fruition. However, the torture Revan endured had splintered his mind in two, and although his lighter half became one with the Force, the darker half rejected death and resolved to destroy the Emperor. Vitiate’s physical body had already been destroyed in battle, but his hibernating spirit lingered, so Revan planned to resurrect the Emperor to a physical form to destroy him permanently. A coalition of Imperial and Republic forces, fearing the dark Revan’s meddling would only bring untold destruction, joined together with Revan’s light side spirit and defeated him on Yavin 4. Though Vitiate reawakened and escaped to the galaxy at large, the two halves of Revan merged together in peace and died a final battle. Revan's influence on the galaxy continued for many millennia, shaping Force ideology and military strategy. The Sith Lord Darth Bane discovered Revan's Sith Holocron and used its teachings to destroy the reigning Brotherhood of Darkness and as the philosophical foundation for the Rule of Two, paving the way for Darth Sidious and his Galactic Empire."

        "description": "Galen Marek, codenamed Starkiller, was a Force-sensitive Human male who trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force as the secret apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. The son of two Jedi Knights—Kento Marek and his wife, Mallie—Galen was born with an exceptionally powerful connection to the Force. Intrigued by the boy's potential, Vader abducted Galen from his home planet of Kashyyyk and raised him to embrace the teachings of the Sith. Having been taken by the Dark Lord of the Sith at a young age, Galen ultimately forgot his past along with his birth name, and only knew himself by the call sign of \"Starkiller.\" Though essentially trained as a Sith apprentice, the Rule of Two prevented Starkiller from truly claiming the title of Sith Lord. He therefore dedicated years of his life to becoming strong enough to help Vader overthrow his own Sith Master, Darth Sidious, the Emperor of the galaxy. In 3 BBY, three years before the Battle of Yavin, Starkiller was deemed ready by his master to hunt Jedi targets. As a result, the Jedi fugitives Rahm Kota, Kazdan Paratus, and Shaak Ti were defeated, in turn, by Vader's assassin. Having emerged triumphant against all three Jedi Masters in single combat, Starkiller believed that the time had come to confront Sidious at his master's side. Instead, Vader betrayed and severely wounded his apprentice at the behest of his own master. Despite this turn of events, Starkiller was saved by Vader and ordered to raise a rebellion against the Empire, leading the apprentice to believe that their plan to depose Sidious was still in motion. Operating under the guise of a Jedi, Starkiller recruited several malcontents to his movement, including the Imperial senators Bail Prestor Organa, Garm Bel Iblis, and Mon Mothma. Together, they formally established the Alliance to Restore the Republic, at which point Vader betrayed Starkiller once more by capturing the Rebel leaders and leaving his apprentice for dead on the planet Corellia. Starkiller not only survived, but pursued his master to the Death Star in a quest to save his newfound allies from the Emperor. In doing so, the former apprentice embraced his Jedi heritage and reclaimed his original identity as Galen Marek. Upon defeating his former master in a lightsaber duel, Marek was tempted—with Sidious' encouragement—to strike down Darth Vader and take his place in the Order of the Sith Lords. Rather than succumbing to the dark side once more, Marek chose to sacrifice his life in order to save the senators. In his final moments, Marek's thoughts were with Juno Eclipse, the woman he developed an emotional attachment to during his time as Vader's apprentice. His death as a martyr had a galvanizing effect on the Rebels, who adopted the Marek family crest to honor their fallen leader, as they went to war against the Empire. Marek's legacy would also live on through a series of clones commissioned by Vader in an effort to create a more powerful and obedient version of Starkiller. To that end, Marek's corpse was taken to Kamino where it was used as a genetic template, resulting in the creation of numerous failures as well as two relatively stable clones—Subject 1138 and the Dark Apprentice."

He was a mentor and close friend to both Anakin Skywalker and his son, Luke, training them in the ways of the Force. Born on the planet Stewjon, Kenobi became the Padawan learner of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Kenobi then became the first Jedi in a millennium to defeat a Sith Lord when he defeated Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo. During the battle, Jinn was mortally wounded by Maul, and perished in Kenobi's arms. At Jinn's behest, Kenobi took Anakin Skywalker to be his own Padawan, training him during the decade leading up to the Clone Wars. During the Clone Wars, Skywalker was made a Jedi Knight while Kenobi (as a result of his military successes in the Outer Rim) was granted the title of Master and named to the Jedi Council. The two Jedi fought alongside each other as generals many times. In the last days of the Clone Wars, Skywalker turned to the dark side, betraying the Jedi. Skywalker's new Sith Master, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, used Order 66 to destroy the Jedi Order, though Kenobi survived and reunited with another survivor, Grand Master Yoda. Kenobi confronted Skywalker, who had now taken the name Darth Vader, on Mustafar, and the two dueled. Kenobi emerged the victor, gravely wounding Vader and remorsefully leaving him for dead. However, as Palpatine established the Galactic Empire in place of the Galactic Republic, Vader was rehabilitated, though he was forced to rely on a cybernetic suit for life support. Kenobi went into exile on Tatooine, where he would watch over Vader's newborn son, Luke Skywalker, who he took to live with his aunt and uncle, Beru and Owen Lars. Seventeen years into his exile, he eventually confronted his old enemy Maul, who he again defeated in a brief duel. As the former Sith lay dying in Kenobi's arms, the two finally made peace, and Maul stated that Luke would avenge them both. In 0 BBY, Kenobi received a message via R2-D2 from Leia Organa asking for help in the Rebel Alliance's fight against the Empire. The droid contained the plans to the Death Star, a battle station created by the Empire capable of destroying planets, and the plans needed to be taken to Bail Organa on Alderaan. After Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle were killed by Imperial forces searching for the plans, Skywalker agreed to join Kenobi on this mission and be trained as a Jedi. The pair were taken to Alderaan by Han Solo, only for them to discover that the planet had been destroyed by the Death Star. Their ship, the Millennium Falcon, was captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, and Kenobi was confronted by Darth Vader. Vader and Kenobi dueled again, and Kenobi allowed Vader to kill him so that Luke and his companions could escape the Death Star. In the following years, as Luke continued fighting for the Rebel Alliance, Kenobi continued to give him guidance as a Force spirit, including directing Luke to the planet Dagobah, where Luke received training from one of Obi-Wan's Masters, Yoda."

Although he was once a Jedi Master, Dooku left the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic after growing disillusioned with the corruption in the government. Turning from the light he once served as a Jedi, Dooku joined the dark side of the Force and became the apprentice of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, taking on the name Darth Tyranus and reclaiming his title as the Count of Serenno. With his master, who was secretly Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, Dooku conspired to overthrow both the Republic and the Jedi so that the Sith could reclaim their former dominance. To this end, he oversaw a growing secessionist movement that ultimately resulted in the formation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to rallying rebellious star systems to the Separatist cause, Dooku was involved in the creation of the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic, having supplied the Kaminoans with the clone template, Jango Fett, as well as the inhibitor chip containing Clone Protocol 66. As a result of Dooku and Sidious's machinations, the galaxy became engulfed by the Clone Wars twenty-two years before the Battle of Yavin. Count Dooku led the Confederacy's battle droid army throughout the war, turning star systems against the Republic through political maneuverings and military force. Though he was bound by the Sith Rule of Two, Dooku trained apprentices of his own, with the intention of one day succeeding his master. He first trained Asajj Ventress; later, after Sidious ordered him to dispose of Ventress, Dooku took on a second apprentice, Savage Opress. The tutelage was short-lived, as Opress had been used by Ventress as a tool of revenge against her former master. Toward the end of the war, Dooku took on a third apprentice, the fallen Jedi Quinlan Vos, with whom he plotted to overthrow his master. This apprenticeship, too, was cut short, as Vos was redeemed in the Force with the help of Asajj Ventress. The final days of the war saw a battle over Coruscant. In a duel aboard the Separatist flagship Invisible Hand, Dooku was defeated by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who beheaded the helpless Dooku at Palpatine's command. Dooku was soon replaced as Palpatine's apprentice by Skywalker himself, who fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader. Despite Dooku's death, the plans he helped set into motion during the Clone Wars came to pass, with the destruction of the Jedi Order and the rise of the Galactic Empire."

During his time in the Jedi Order, he once served as elected leader of the Jedi and, during the Clone Wars, as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. He was the greatest champion of the Jedi Order and promoted its ancient traditions amidst the growing influence of the dark side of the Force in the corrupt, declining days of the Republic. When the Separatist Crisis spawned the birth of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and sparked the Clone Wars, Windu and the Jedi rallied to the defense of the Republic and became the leaders of the Grand Army of the Republic. Throughout the war, Windu served the Jedi and the Republic in various capacities—on the battlefield in command of the clone army, on Coruscant as an overseer of the war effort and an advisor to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, and even as a diplomat to contested worlds, despite his disdain of politics. His exploits on the frontline served as a reminder of his reputation as a renowned Jedi warrior. As the war drew to a close, Windu became increasingly suspicious of the chancellor's motives, as Palpatine had amassed near-dictatorial control over the Galactic Senate, and sensed the rising power of the dark side in the galaxy. His suspicions were confirmed when Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight and the Chosen One of ancient prophecy, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who manipulated the Republic and the Separatist Alliance into war. Windu, along with Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, confronted Palpatine with the intention of arresting him. Instead, the Dark Lord attacked them, striking them down one by one until only Windu was left. Windu bested Palpatine in the confrontation and—deciding the chancellor was too dangerous to be left alive due to his influence over the government—prepared to strike him down, but the intervention of Anakin Skywalker, who saved the chancellor's life, led to Windu's death. As a result, Skywalker fell to the temptation of the dark side and was renamed Darth Vader. Windu's actions led Palpatine to brand the Jedi as traitors to the Republic. The chancellor executed Order 66, and clone troopers across the galaxy turned against and killed their Jedi leaders, marking the fall of the Jedi Order. Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire, and the Emperor's new regime promoted anti-Jedi sentiment across the galaxy. Through propaganda, the Empire portrayed Windu as the leader of a criminal gang of Jedi who caused the outbreak of the Clone Wars. In spite of the propaganda, some of Windu's actions were remembered with fondness; General Cham Syndulla, who served alongside Windu during the Battle of Ryloth, remembered Windu with great respect and told the tale of how Windu helped him liberate Ryloth during the war."

During the crisis on Naboo in 32 BBY, Maul confronted Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. Although he succeeded in killing the former, Maul was defeated and maimed by Jinn's apprentice, who left the Sith Lord for dead. As a result of Maul's defeat and apparent death, Sidious replaced him with Count Dooku, Jinn's Jedi mentor who adopted the Sith persona of Darth Tyranus. Fueled by his hatred for Kenobi, Maul survived and reconstructed himself as a cyborg, although the experience of his defeat also drove him insane. He was presumed dead for over a decade until his brother, Savage Opress, found Maul and restabilized his mind with the help of Mother Talzin. By that time the Clone Wars raged across the galaxy, with the Jedi-led clone forces of the Republic battling against the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems as intended by Maul's former Sith Master. Believing he had been cheated out of his place in galactic history, Maul embarked on a personal quest for revenge against Kenobi, whom he blamed for his fate. He also used the galactic conflict as an opportunity to form his own criminal empire, the Shadow Collective through various alliances which included the Pyke Syndicate, the Black Sun, and the Death Watch. Their combined resources enabled Maul to overthrow the New Mandalorians and install a puppet government on Mandalore. However, as his power and influence increased, Maul became a threat to Sidious' own plans for the future. The Dark Lord confronted Maul in person; after killing Opress, Sidious denounced his former apprentice as a Sith no longer due to the Rule of Two. Despite Maul's efforts to avenge his brother, he was defeated and overpowered by Sidious' command of the Force. In the waning days of the Clone Wars, Maul escaped from Sidious and ultimately returned to Mandalore where he was overthrown by former Padawan Ahsoka Tano and an army of clone troopers. However, Maul survived the war and continued to build his own empire as a crime lord and the secret leader of Crimson Dawn. He was later stranded on the planet Malachor, where he hoped to destroy the Sith by unlocking the superweapon at the heart of the Sith temple. Maul's plan was thwarted by two Jedi, Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, the latter of whom Maul hoped to corrupt as his own apprentice. After escaping Malachor, Maul continued to try to tempt Bridger to the dark side before ultimately learning that Kenobi was still alive in spite of Order 66 and the Jedi Purge. Seeking hope and purpose, Maul sought Kenobi on Tatooine, the planet where he first revealed himself to the Jedi. Kenobi defeated him in a brief lightsaber duel, cutting Maul's lightsaber in half. This finally ended Maul's decade-spanning quest for vengeance as he realized he could not win. Maul died in 2 BBY—a few years before the start of the Galactic Civil War—with the knowledge that Kenobi was protecting Luke Skywalker, finding some peace in the idea that the end of the Sith was at hand and, therefore, he would be avenged."

        "description": "Ahsoka Tano, nicknamed \"Snips\" by her Master and known as \"Ashla\" after the Clone Wars, was a Jedi Padawan who, after the conflict, helped establish a network of various rebel cells against the Galactic Empire. A Togruta female, Tano was discovered on her homeworld of Shili by Jedi Master Plo Koon, who brought her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to receive Jedi training. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda assigned the young Tano to be the Padawan learner of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, whom she joined at the Battle of Christophsis. Whereas Tano was eager to prove herself, Skywalker had a reputation for recklessness, and they had a rather difficult start as Master and apprentice. Yet, they worked together to rescue Rotta, the son of crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and returned Rotta to his father, thus facilitating a crucial alliance between the Hutt Clan and the Galactic Republic. As a commander in the Grand Army of the Republic, Tano found a mentor in Clone Captain Rex of the 501st Legion, with whom she and Skywalker collaborated to lead frontline campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In her first command position at the Battle of Ryloth, Tano disobeyed orders and lost her entire squadron of pilots, but she managed to rebound and helped secure a victory at Ryloth. Her assignments pitted her against a variety of opponents, from General Grievous and Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress to bounty hunters such as Cad Bane and Aurra Sing. Over time, she matured into a respected leader, contributing to key Republic victories like the Second Battle of Geonosis and the Battle of Mon Cala. She even died during a series of events on Mortis, but the Force wielder known as the Daughter sacrificed herself to bring Tano back to life. Tano gained much experience on and beyond the war front, leading a group of Jedi younglings to revolt against their Trandoshan captors, helping rescue a colony of Togruta from enslavement by the Zygerrian Slave Empire, and serving as an advisor to the Onderon rebels—with her close friend, Lux Bonteri, among them—as they liberated their world from the Confederacy. In a stark turn of events, Tano was framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar and other homicides, and she escaped into the Coruscant underworld to clear her name. Though she formed an unlikely alliance with Asajj Ventress, she was detained by Republic forces and was consequently barred from the Jedi Order. Ultimately, Skywalker uncovered the true culprit, Tano's friend and fellow Padawan Barriss Offee, and prevented his former apprentice from being convicted of sedition. Nevertheless, the ordeal dislodged Tano's faith in the Jedi. She refused the Jedi Council's offer to rejoin the Order, instead departing in search of a new path. After the Galactic Empire came to power, Tano went into hiding on Thabeska and Raada. Following the evacuation of Raada, Tano joined Senator Bail Organa's growing rebel movement. She became the manager of his intelligence network and adopted the codename \"Fulcrum.\" As Fulcrum, Tano provided intelligence to various rebel factions including Hera Syndulla's Spectres rebel cell. Tano took a particular interest in Syndulla's rebels because one of their members, a former Jedi named Kanan Jarrus, had begun to train his own Padawan, Ezra Bridger. In addition, Tano's efforts against the Empire brought her into contact with Skywalker, who by then had become the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, as well as the Imperial Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister. Following the mission to Malachor, Tano became lost to the rubble and shadows of the Sith temple and was believed by many including Jarrus and Bridger to have perished during a duel with Darth Vader. However, Tano was unexpectedly saved from Vader's wrath by a future Ezra Bridger, who pulled her through a time portal into the world between worlds, a dimension of the Force connecting all time and space. After a confrontation with Darth Sidious, who desired access to the dimension, Tano returned to her time, promising Bridger that she would find him once she returned. After the end of the Galactic Civil War, Tano returned to a freed Lothal and joined Sabine Wren in her quest to find a missing Bridger, who had disappeared during the liberation of Lothal."

The Coruscant-born Jedi was a controversial figure in his time, having long been a student of the Living Force who often bucked the Jedi Code and the decisions of the Jedi High Council in order to follow the will of the Force. According to his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jinn could have been a member of the High Council had he followed the Code, but he, like his own Jedi Master, Count Dooku, did not always put his faith in institutional wisdom. His studies of the Living Force helped him learn to unlock the secrets of eternal consciousness after death, giving him and the students he would later teach influence beyond death. In 32 BBY, Jinn and Kenobi were sent by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum to negotiate a peaceful outcome to the Trade Federation' blockade of the planet Naboo. The Federation, in league with the shadowy Sith Lord Darth Sidious, targeted them for death and forced them onto the planet, where they rescued Queen Padmé Amidala and helped her find safe refuge on Tatooine. It was there that Jinn helped orchestrate the freedom of a young slave named Anakin Skywalker, a boy who was strong in the Force and who Jinn believed was the Chosen One who would destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force. Once at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Jinn unsuccessfully lobbied for the Council to allow him to train Skywalker. Jinn and Kenobi returned to Naboo, where they helped Queen Amidala liberate her people from the Federation. Jinn was killed in a lightsaber duel with Darth Maul, and with his dying breaths asked Kenobi to train Skywalker. His funeral was held shortly thereafter, but his studies of the Living Force allowed him to manifest his consciousness after death. During the Clone Wars, he revealed himself to Grand Master Yoda and sent Yoda on a journey so he too could learn the secrets of immortality. After the fall of the Jedi Order, Jinn guided Yoda and Kenobi in learning how to physically manifest their spirits, a feat he too was able to accomplish after first only being able to communicate as a disembodied voice. Through Jinn’s teachings, Kenobi and Yoda were able to guide Luke Skywalker even after death as he saved his father from the dark side of the Force, became a Jedi Knight, and sought to rebuild the Jedi Order."

Once a promising student of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, the former Ben Solo was neither Jedi or Sith but a product of both orders' teachings. Though he embraced the dark side of the Force due to the machinations of his predecessor, Supreme Leader Snoke, Ren remained vulnerable to the pull of the light side of the Force. Nevertheless, he was determined to destroy the last remnants of the Jedi Order and also charted his own path to power, believing it was destiny to rule the galaxy. The son of General Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, Ben Solo was born on the Core World Chandrila, on the day the Galactic Empire surrendered to the New Republic in 5 ABY. Though he was given his father's surname, Solo was a Skywalker through his mother. He, therefore, inherited the raw strength of his maternal grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One of the Force. As his own powers manifested in the years following the Galactic Civil War, Solo became part of a new generation of Jedi Knights trained by his maternal uncle, Luke Skywalker. Despite the potential Skywalker saw in his nephew, he also sensed darkness and grew to believe that Snoke succeeded in turning Solo to the dark side. Acting on instinct, Skywalker was prepared to end Solo's life before his future came to pass but could not follow through with the act. Solo felt betrayed, however, and reacted by burning down the training temple, resulting in the massacre of the other apprentices as well as Skywalker's self-imposed exile on the planet Ahch-To. By severing his ties with Skywalker and the Jedi, Solo pledged his loyalty to Snoke and reemerged as Kylo Ren—the Jedi Killer, warlord and champion of the First Order, and Master of the Knights of Ren. In the waning days of the cold war, Ren oversaw the hunt for the map to Skywalker; his intention to kill the last Jedi and, therefore, complete the legacy of the fallen Sith Lord Darth Vader, his grandfather's dark side persona. This journey ultimately led to Ren's encounter with the Jakku scavenger Rey, whose own strength in the Force mirrored Ren's, and with whom he shared an unprecedented Force-bond with. They became allies as their connection grew stronger following Starkiller Base's destruction in 34 ABY, leading to the assassination of Snoke during the First Order–Resistance war. With ambition fueled by the dark side, however, Ren claimed the mantle of Supreme Leader and continued to pursue his goal of galactic domination, causing Rey to withdraw her support despite Ren entreating her to rule by his side. At this point, the New Republic had fallen; the Resistance, a group of insurgents led by Ren's mother, was decimated at the Battle of Crait; and Skywalker became one with the Force upon sacrificing his life to save the last remnants of the Resistance."

        "planetofOrigin": "Naboo",
        "lightaberColor": ["red"],
        "description": "Darth Sidious, a Force-sensitive human male, was the Dark Lord of the Sith who founded the Galactic Empire after toppling its predecessor, the Galactic Republic from within. Prior to his term as Supreme Chancellor and subsequent reign as the Galactic Emperor, Sidious was born approximately eighty-four years before the Battle of Yavin and given the name Sheev Palpatine during the Age of the Republic. A native of the Mid Rim planet Naboo, Palpatine pursued a career in politics and eventually became his homeworld's representative in the Galactic Senate. Although he cultivated the persona of an honest and trustworthy public servant, Senator Palpatine was an ambitious Sith Lord who learned the ways of the dark side of the Force during his secret apprenticeship under Darth Plagueis. Following in a lineage of Dark Lords that began with Darth Bane, who reformed the Sith a millennium prior to the Fall of the Republic, Sidious spent years conspiring to restore his Order to galactic dominance. After killing his Sith Master, he trained an apprentice of his own, the Dathomirian assassin Darth Maul in accordance with the Rule of Two—Bane's decree that there should only be two Sith Lords at any given time. In 32 BBY the Trade Federation invaded Naboo under Sidious' orders. Using the situation to his advantage, he manipulated his monarch, Queen Padmé Amidala into leading the Senate to remove Chancellor Finis Valorum from office, thereby enabling Palpatine to replace him as the next and last Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Despite the loss of his apprentice during the Battle of Naboo, Sidious' plans proceeded apace with the aid of Maul's replacement—the fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku, who assumed the name of Darth Tyranus after turning away from the Jedi Order he once served. Together, Master and apprentice engineered a secessionist movement that tore the thousand-year democratic union asunder, leaving the galaxy divided and on the brink of war between the Republic and the newly-formed Confederacy of Independent Systems. Hence, in 22 BBY the galaxy fell into a state open war for the first time since the formation of the Republic. Having masterminded the conflict, Sidious was able to control both governments throughout the Clone Wars. Near the war's end in 19 BBY, several members of the Jedi High Council moved to arrest the Chancellor upon discovering his true identity as the Dark Lord. The attempt ultimately failed, however, due to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, whom Sidious influenced into betraying the Jedi. Replacing the late Tyranus with Skywalker, who adopted the name of Darth Vader as Sidious' third and final apprentice, the Sith Lords initiated Order 66 and, therefore, began a systematic purge that all but annihilated the Jedi Order. After the fall of the Jedi, the Clone Wars ended with Sidious' ascension as Emperor of the First Galactic Empire. Under the New Order program, the last vestiges of the Republic gradually disappeared. In 0 BBY the Emperor formally disbanded the Imperial Senate and would henceforth rule by delegating authority to an upper cadre of regional governors known as Moffs, such as Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Shortly afterward, however, the Death Star—a moon-sized battle station with the capacity to obliterate entire planets—was destroyed by the Alliance to Restore the Republic in the Battle of Yavin. As the galaxy fell into another state of all-out war, known as the Galactic Civil War, the Emperor tasked his apprentice to hunt down and eradicate the Rebels, all the while constructing a second Death Star in the Endor system. Despite the challenge to his reign, Sidious grew increasingly occupied by his fascination with the Unknown Regions and, therefore, commissioned the exploration of that vast region of space. By then, Sidious also learned that Vader sired a son, Luke Skywalker, who trained to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him. Sensing an opportunity to replace his hobbled disciple with a younger and stronger pupil, Sidious tried to turn the aspiring Jedi to the dark side and even manipulated him into dueling with Vader during the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. However, in failing to turn Skywalker from the light side of the Force, he unleashed the power of the dark side by torturing the young Jedi with a barrage of Force lightning. But the agony he inflicted on his apprentice's son caused the former Anakin Skywalker to overthrow his dark Master at the cost of his own life, resulting in the complete destruction of the Sith as foretold in the prophecy of the Chosen One. While Sidious had been defeated, the Empire would attempt to maintain the charade of his survival, while struggling to fill the void left by his absence. But Sidious had never intended to be replaced. Prior to his demise, he created the Contingency to seemingly destroy the Empire in the event of his death, propagating the idea that Sidious believed the Empire did not deserve to survive without its Emperor. As a consequence, the Imperial remnants were further weakened and less able to resist the New Republic during the waning days of the Galactic Civil War. Ultimately, the Empire capitulated the war after the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, ending the era founded by Darth Sidious. Following his death, Sidious' legacy became the base of what became the First Order, a hermit state led by Supreme Leader Snoke, who was also a practitioner of the dark side of the Force. The reign of Snoke would untimely end with his death at the hands of his own apprentice and Skywalker's grandson Kylo Ren, who succeeded his master as the new Supreme Leader, desiring to let the past die along with the Jedi and the Sith."

Before becoming a Sith Lord, he lost everything during the Galactic Republic's war against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. He survived the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon during the war's final battle at the planet of Malachor V, which surrounded the planet with a destructive spatial phenomenon known as a mass shadow. Experiencing the shadow that obliterated almost everything on and around the planet made Nihilus crave Force energy. The affliction painfully ravaged his body while rendering him a wound in the Force. He was found by a seeker of these, the Sith Lord Darth Traya, who told him that she could teach him to feed his endless hunger. He accepted her offer of apprenticeship at the Trayus Academy on Malachor V, where he, over time, became one of three concurrent Dark Lords of the Sith. Together, they formed a triumvirate with Traya at its head and her other apprentice, Darth Sion, as the third member. The trio chose individual titles for themselves, Darth Nihilus becoming the Lord of Hunger. The apprentices grew in strength throughout their training and eventually overpowered their Master. Sion defeated Traya, while Nihilus sapped her energy. The two Sith then combined power to sever her connection to the Force and sent her into exile. Nihilus' affliction developed to the point where the Dark Lord was forced to call upon the dark side of the Force to encase his spirit within his mask and armor to stay alive. Sion and he then began a Jedi purge, causing the virtual extinction of the Jedi Order. Nihilus was responsible for the devastation of the planet Katarr in 3952 BBY, killing and absorbing the Force energy of the Jedi at the Conclave on Katarr along with every other living thing on the world save one Miraluka woman named Visas Marr. Marr was collected from the surface and Nihilus began to train her as his Shadow Hand. One year later, Nihilus sensed a growing presence in the Force and sent Marr out to eliminate it. That presence was a female Jedi, Meetra Surik, who was on a quest to find the few Jedi Masters who had survived the Purge. When Marr attempted to assassinate the woman, Surik defeated her and convinced her to turn to the light side of the Force in the process. Although Nihilus returned to lurking the fringes of known space, he was eventually tricked by Traya into initiating the Battle of Telos IV in an attempt to absorb a Jedi Academy that lacked any Force-sensitives aside from the headmistress. Nihilus met a large Republic and Mandalorian fleet at Telos that distracted him. Meanwhile, his flagship, the Ravager, was secretly boarded by a small force consisting of Surik, Marr, Mandalore the Preserver, and his Mandalorians. The trio confronted and slew Nihilus in the ensuing duel while the Mandalorians rigged explosives that destroyed the ship. The Sith Lord's armor maintained his spirit and was collected for burial on the Sith homeworld of Korriban, where his soul could be contacted with a holocron of his own creation."

Though initially unaware of her connection to the Force, Rey's powers would manifest during the waning days of the cold war, consequently leading her on the path to becoming a Jedi under the guidance of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Born in 15 ABY, Rey spent much of her time in solitude eking out a life as a scavenger and mechanic in the Jakku desert. Abandoned by her parents at an early age, she learned to survive without a family by scavenging various materials from the battlefield site of the last conflict in the Galactic Civil War, all the while honing her skills as a warrior and pilot. Her solitary life was interrupted, however, by the First Order and the Resistance's race to locate Skywalker—a race that led both factions to Rey's homeworld. Compelled to help the Resistance, Rey befriended the astromech droid BB-8 and a renegade stormtrooper named Finn, as well as the war veterans Han Solo and his Wookiee ally Chewbacca. She also found a nemesis in Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo who fell to the dark side of the Force and became a champion of the First Order. With her powers growing at an exponential rate, Rey completed the Resistance's search for Skywalker by tracking him to the planet Ahch-To in the Unknown Regions. Though she hoped to rediscover a living legend, especially in a time when the First Order stood poised to conquer the galaxy following the destruction of the New Republic, Rey instead found an embittered hermit who chose to live in exile after failing to prevent his nephew Ren's fall from the light side of the Force. Faced with a reluctant teacher whose final goal was to die as the last of the Jedi Order, Rey increasingly turned to Ren in whom she placed her faith as the galaxy's last hope. Through the Force-bond that bridged their minds across millions of light-years, Rey sensed the conflict within the former Ben Solo and was convinced that he could be redeemed with her help. But despite her belief in Solo, who indeed killed his master Snoke with Rey's help, Ren chose to remain on the dark path and ultimately claimed the mantle of Supreme Leader for himself. Rey returned to the Resistance alone, having rejected Ren's entreaty to rule the galaxy together.

R5 knew what he had to do, and suddenly set off a mild explosion inside himself, leading Luke to believe that he had a busted motivator. Skippy then used the Force on 3PO, telling Luke to buy R2 instead.

        "description": "Snoke, a Force-sensitive humanoid alien male, was a mysterious being who rose to become Supreme Leader of the First Order during the New Republic Era. Although he was a master of the dark side of the Force, Snoke was not a member of the Sith Order, which became extinct as a result of the deaths of the last two Sith Lords, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. Like the Sith, he regarded the Jedi Order as a threat to his plans, and sought to complete their destruction while pursuing an agenda of galactic conquest. Snoke, who was fascinated by the power of the Skywalker bloodline, succeeded in luring Ben Solo—the grandson of Darth Vader—away from the Jedi path. As a result, the reborn Jedi Order was all but destroyed, leaving Solo's uncle and mentor, Luke Skywalker, as the last living Jedi. With the newly anointed Kylo Ren, master of the Knights of Ren, at his side, Snoke believed that his new disciple would succeed where the Sith failed by completely destroying the Jedi, and therefore hope in the galaxy. Under Snoke's rule, the First Order forged a mighty technological war machine, intending to bring the galaxy under the control of a central government not seen since the reign of the Galactic Empire. At the time, it was decided by Snoke that the First Order would be governed from his flagship, the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy, rather than a traditional planetary capital. Ultimately, the cold war between the First Order and New Republic ended in 34 ABY when Snoke allowed General Armitage Hux to fire Starkiller Base's superweapon on the entire Hosnian system, annihilating the Republic headquarters on Hosnian Prime along with the Galactic Senate. He then oversaw the First Order's efforts to eradicate the Resistance while simultaneously using his Force powers to bridge the minds of Ren and Rey, a Jakku scavenger who trained with Skywalker and developed a Force-bond with Snoke's dark apprentice. After luring Rey to the Supremacy, Snoke ordered Ren to complete his training by executing the Jedi aspirant. Instead, Ren betrayed and killed his master, saving Rey in the process before ultimately becoming the new Supreme Leader of the First Order."

        "description": "Arcann was a Force-sensitive male Human who was the son of Senya Tirall and Valkorion, the \"Immortal Emperor\" of the Eternal Empire of Zakuul. He was the twin brother of Thexan, with whom he led a series of raids against the worlds of the larger galaxy. During the attack on Korriban Arcann was caught in an explosion that took his left arm and scarred the left side of his face, necessitating cybernetic replacements. Subsequently, Arcann became furious at the indifference of Valkorion and attempted to kill him, only for Thexan to intervene and be struck down by Arcann's lightsaber instead. When Valkorion offered to share his power with the Outlander, Arcann attempted to assassinate Valkorion again, which was successful, killing Valkorion's physical body while his spirit attached himself to the Outlander, whom Arcann trapped by freezing in carbonite. Arcann assumed his father's Eternal Throne and led the Eternal Empire in a massive invasion of the larger galaxy, which prevailed over both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic within a year, forcing them to pay tribute and making Zakuul the dominant power in the galaxy. Arcann ruled as Emperor for five years after his father's death, until the Outlander was rescued from carbonite and started a revolt against the Eternal Empire. During the Battle of Odessen, Arcann was defeated by the Outlander and taken by his mother to recuperate, while Arcann's sister Vaylin along with SCORPIO took over the Eternal Throne in his absence"

        "description": "Tenebrae—known to the Old Sith Empire as Vitiate, his reconstituted Sith Empire as the Sith Emperor, and his Eternal Empire as Valkorion—was an ancient dark side entity of enormous power who manipulated galactic affairs for 1,500 years. Born in 5113 BBY as the Sith son of Lord Dramath, Tenebrae carved a path of destruction across the planet Medriaas, torturing and massacring thousands by the age of ten. When Dramath confronted him, Tenebrae stripped away his father’s power and imprisoned his spirit for millennia of torment. Eventually, the Dark Lord of the Sith Marka Ragnos recognized Tenebrae's power and christened him as Lord Vitiate—the new ruler of Medriaas. Vitiate renamed the world Nathema and ruled it for the next century, distancing himself from Sith power struggles. Following Naga Sadow’s defeat in the Great Hyperspace War, Vitiate lured the remaining Sith Lords to Nathema and, in an elaborate ritual, drained their life essence and that of the entire planet, increasing his powers and prolonging his life. Shedding his identity as Lord Vitiate, the self-proclaimed Sith Emperor led the scattered Sith survivors to Dromund Kaas and established a new Sith Empire. As the Empire secretly expanded over the next thousand years, the Emperor discovered the lost world of Zakuul and the Eternal Fleet—an ancient armada of unmatched technology. Dissatisfied with Sith ideology, the Emperor transferred his essence into a Zakuulan warrior named Valkorion and created a vast civilization known as the Eternal Empire. The Emperor desired absolute immortality to fully experience and expand his new creation across galaxies without the threat of being killed, so he planned to initiate a war between his Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. The deaths caused by the conflict would fuel a new ritual that would allow him to consume almost everything in the galaxy and become an all-powerful god. As the Emperor’s plans neared completion, he orchestrated the Mandalorian Wars as a preliminary test invasion of the Republic, but two powerful Jedi Knights—Revan and Malak—defeated the Mandalorians and tracked down his Sith Empire. The Emperor dominated their minds, but the pair soon broke free from his control and betrayed him—and each other—in the resultant Jedi Civil War that nearly destroyed the Jedi Order. Years later, a redeemed Revan, reimprisoned in stasis, waged a mental war against the Emperor, amplifying his fear of death to delay the Great Galactic War by three centuries. When the war finally erupted, the Sith Empire quickly took the offensive, conquered Coruscant, and destroyed the Jedi Temple. However, Revan influenced the Emperor—distracted by the births of his children on Zakuul—to sue for peace instead of pushing forward, prompting the Treaty of Coruscant. After a decade of uneasy peace, the truce collapsed, and open warfare between the Jedi and Sith resumed. The Emperor attempted to initiate his galaxy-wide ritual, but a powerful Jedi Knight known as the Hero of Tython thwarted his efforts and destroyed his Voice, a host body that encapsulated his essence and power, in battle on Dromund Kaas. His wounded spirit went into slumber on Yavin IV, but a returned and crazed Revan attempted to resurrect the weakened Emperor to a physical form to permanently destroy him. A coalition of Imperial and Republic forces, believing Revan's meddling would result in the Emperor consuming the galaxy, defeated Revan before the ritual began, but the Emperor’s spirit nevertheless fed off the battle and reawakened. Rejuvenated, the Emperor consumed the planet of Ziost to return to full power. Valkorion once more, he revealed the Eternal Empire to the galaxy as his twin sons—Arcann and Thexan—invaded the known galaxy and captured a famous champion later known as the Outlander. Judging the Outlander alone to be a worthy adversary, Valkorion orchestrated his death at the hands of Arcann and embedded his consciousness within the Outlander's mind. Valkorion counseled and shaped the Outlander into a vessel of supreme power as the champion defeated Arcann, then his sister Vaylin, and disabled the Eternal Fleet. However, Valkorion then revealed his true plan—that he had allowed his children to ravage the galaxy so that, once overthrown by the Outlander, he would take over the champion's body and command the galaxy as a heroic liberator. In a final clash of wills, the Outlander, aided by Valkorion's own family, overpowered the ancient entity, sending him into oblivion."

        "description": "Sha'a Gi was a Human male from the planet Ord Biniir. As a child, his Force-sensitivity was discovered by Jedi Master Daakman Barrek. Taking Gi as his Padawan, Barrek accompanied him to Coruscant so that the youth could begin his training as a Jedi. During his training, Gi was less than proficient in the martial skills of the Order but excelled in computer system operation. As a result, he aspired to work in the Jedi Archives after passing his Jedi Trials. Gi and his Master formed an effective partnership, gathering intelligence and disrupting pirate activity throughout the Outer Rim Territories. When the Clone Wars broke out in 22 BBY, Gi and Barrek continued their intelligence-gathering operations and discovered a Confederacy of Independent Systems droid factory in operation on the planet Hypori. Barrek called in a Republic task force to destroy the factory, but the reinforcements were ravaged by orbital mines, and the entire force crashed onto the surface of the planet. Gi and Barrek regrouped with several Jedi survivors. Surrounded by droid forces, Barrek was killed by the leader of the Droid Army, a cyborg called General Grievous. As the remaining Jedi took cover in the wreck of a downed Acclamator-class assault ship and waited for Grievous to engage them in battle, Gi—overcome by fear and the loss of his Master—panicked and rushed out into the open, where he was killed by Grievous."
