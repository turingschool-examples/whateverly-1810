  a factor in an Elder's immortality was the will to live and that Matani had
  lost hers. Tivan then decided he would not suffer the same fate, and looked
  for a goal to which he could dedicate his life`

  bio: `Odin, also known as the Usurper or the Destroyer, came to destroy
  Aesheim (Earth), as it was tainted by his brother the Serpent's corruption.
  At Wrlstead Arms, Sigmund was killed, and Odin, realizing he needed to give
  man a paradise, chose Brunnhilde as his Valkyrie, for her to take the souls
  of the warriors perished in battle with honor and bring them to Valhalla
  She led the Valkyrior, the Choosers of the Slain, a group of warrior
  goddesses who would appear over the battlefields of mortal worshippers of
  the Asgardian gods and choose which of the fallen were worthy to be taken to
  Valhalla, the land of the honoured dead in the dimension of Asgard. Brunnhilde
  served Asgard capably in this capacity for centuries.`

  bio: `Little is known about the life of Nebula before the time she hijacked
  Sanctuary II, the solar orbiting satellite built and used as a base of
  operations by Thanos. A short time before Thanos became permanently
  transfixed between life and death, Nebula sent a small band of her most
  trusted aides to Sanctuary II to repair its hyperdrive engines and teleport
  the station out of the solar system. The underlings were met by the Avenger
  then known as Captain Marvel, who had been sent to investigate possible
  activity. Nebula's minions warped the satellite out of the solar system with
  Captain Marvel aboard and rendezvoused with Nebula. She planned to conquer
  the Skrull empire, which was then in chaos after the destruction of its
  throneworld by the planet-devourer Galactus. Not knowing how to return home,
  Captain Marvel pretended to go along with Nebula's scheme, but actually
  helped the Skrulls evacuate the outpost world Nebula was intent on destroying.`
